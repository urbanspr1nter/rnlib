# rnlib
A collection of amateur C++ utilities for getting POCs written in C++ delivered faster

## Introduction
`rnlib` is a personal C++ library I've written to help myself get projects up and running faster. It is designed to
help me learn more C++. Functionality and POC is a priority, so the set of utilities that come with this library is
useful for that.

This library provides:
* string manipulation utilities such as string splitting
* vector and map transformation tools
* csv reading
* ... and more in the future.
